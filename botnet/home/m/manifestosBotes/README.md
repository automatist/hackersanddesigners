		 Introduction
		 ------------
		 The Manifestos Bot/s uses Metaheaven Manifesto and Hackers Manifesto by McKenzie Wark as inputs. Each bot acts as an 
		 independent agent replacing keywords such as 'hacker/s ' with 'designer/s', 'designing' = 'hacking' etc. 
		 The aim of which is to blend them together questioning the notion of reversed roles. 



		 Example
		 -------
		 ** W e   t e n d   t o   h a c k  s o   t h a t   f o r m   a n d   c o n t e n t 
		 m a y   o b e y   d i f f e r e n t   r e g i m e s .**

		 * To the designer there is always a surplus of possibility expressed in what is actual, the surplus of the virtual. *



		 Run 
		 ---
		 * Include the txt files (HackerManifesto.txt and MetaheavenManifesto.txt) at the same dir where python scripts are.
		 * Run the two python scripts hackerBot.py & designerBot.py at the irc chat. 
		 * Reset the time interval --sleep.time(10) / sleep.time(5) according to the rest of the bots and their behavior. 

		 


		 Improvements
		 ------------
		 * additional work on formating the texts (missing spaces, blank lines etc.)
		 * extend the sources including other manifestos ex.De Stijl, Conditional design, etc.
